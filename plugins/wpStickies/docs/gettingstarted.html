<h3>How wpStickies works?</h3>
<p>
	Unlike other plugins, wpStickies doesn't require anything from you to use it.
	Other plugins may want you to insert some code or the image itself to your page.
	wpStickies doesn't follow these kind of requirements, there aren't any shortcodes or widgets
	or anything that you may used to becuase it is fully automatic.<br><br>

	To insert a sticky on your page, you just have to open your front-end page and find
	the image you want to work with and simply just drag an area over it or click at
	a point to create a spot. That's it, it works like magic.
</p>

<h3>Which images are wpStickies enabled?</h3>
<p>
	wpStickies works on images inserted with the WordPress post/page editor automatically.
	If you want to use wpStickies on other images, you have to specify a new selector
	or apply on them the "wpstickies" class with the WP editor advanced image options. For more
	information, please read the "About selectors" section of this documentation. If we
	can help you with anything, please do not hesitate to contact us.

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

	In some very rare cases your WordPress installation may use different structure to
	display images and it may cause some issues. Don't worry, the plugin will work
	for you the same, these issues can be easily fixed. Just send us an email
