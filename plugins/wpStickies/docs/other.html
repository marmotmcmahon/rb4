<h3>My Media</h3>
<p>
	Under the My Media sub-page you can see and filter all your uploaded images to tag them with wpStickies. It offers a convenient way to quickly and easily tag images without visiting the corresponding front-end pages where they belong to. This media editor can also be used to tag images used in certain posts and pages, and the plugin will provide you a quick access link on the right sidebar when you are editing them.

<h3>CSS editor</h3>
<p>
	Since version 2.1.0, wpStickies has a CSS editor where you can enter custom CSS code to further change the plugin's appearance beyond the provided styling options. <br><br>

	<strong>Please note, the CSS editor requires some CSS knowledge. Entering invalid CSS code could break the appearance of your site badly.</strong>
