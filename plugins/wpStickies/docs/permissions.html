<h3>Provide plugin access to non-admin users</h3>
<p>
	If you want to share your tags administration with other (non-admin) users, you can
	find the relevant options under Plugin Settings -> General -> Permissions. There are several predefined 
	options, but you can also select "Custom" to enter a custom capability. See the 
	<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Capability_vs._Role_Table" target="_blank">Codex</a> for more informations about roles and capabilities. <strong>Please note, these settings are only responsible for accessing wpStickies' admin pages.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Non-admin users can only manage your tags by default. If you tick the "Allow changing plugin settings" option they will also be able to alter any plugin setting, which includes permission settings as well. Be aware the risks when you enable this option.
</p>

<h3>Allow non-admin users to add/modify tags</h3>
<p>
	You can find mostly the same options described in the previous entry to control who can add/modify tags on your images. These settings can be found under Plugin Settings -> Permissions, where you can edit permissions for adding and modifying tags separately.
</p>

<p>
	Since your permission preferences might also include non-trusted users, we've created a pending
	list where you can review all the changes made before they goes public. Options related to the pending list are also separated based on adding/modifying tags, so you can choose the right action to be performed after certain events. For example, you can re-valuate edited tags, or just completely ignore the pending list if only trusted users can make changes.
</p>

<h3>Do I have to accept my own tags?</h3>
<p>
	No, every action you take is immediate if you're an administrator. For other users it depends on the permission preferences set in plugin's settings.
</p>

<h3>About the "wpStickies admins" group</h3>
<p>
	The plugin creates you a new user role called "wpStickies admins" after installation. The members of this
	group has basic capabilities, much like subscribers. The only difference is that they can add/modify
	tags if you choose it in your permission settings.
</p>

<h3>Restore removed tags</h3>
<p>
	Rejecting a pending sticky or removing any of them won't delete it immediately. These
	stickies will still be available under Stickies -> Restore. Later you can decide
	to restore or delete them permanently, but they are invisible and acting like deleted in the meantime.
