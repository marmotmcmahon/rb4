<h3>What are the selectors?</h3>
<p>
	The selectors are patterns for selecting elements that you want to work with.
	wpStickies works on images inserted with the WP post/page editor automatically. This
	is also achieved with selectors. Specifying a new selector will allow you to apply
	wpStickies on your custom images or even HTML elements with background. You can also
	use selectors to prevent wpStickies applying on your images you don't want to.
</p>

<h3>How selectors works?</h3>
<p>
	To understand how the selectors works, you need some web development experience,
	especially with the HTML DOM structure. The most basic selectors are using namespaces,
	the HTML element names. For example, in HTML, you can insert an image with the &lt;img&gt;
	element. In selectors, you can use the "img" selector to apply wpStickies on every
	images. You can reference elements with a specific class name with a dot at the beginning
	of your selector. For example: ".wpstickies". To reference an element with an ID, you can
	use the hash mark: "#customid". These are the basics of the selectors.<br><br>

	You can pile up these selectors for more accourate results. For example, if you want to
	apply wpStickies on images, which are inside HTML elements with class name "entry", you can use the following:
	".entry img". If you have a main content area that holds all your content and has an ID "content", you can
	extend our example selector for a more accurate results: "#content .entry img".
