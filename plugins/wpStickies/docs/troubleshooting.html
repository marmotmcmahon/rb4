<h3>Troubleshooting options</h3>
<p>
	The Troubleshooting section in the plugin settings contains options to improve the plugin's performance when it's possible and to avoid common incompatibility issues with other themes and plugins. <br><br>

	<strong>Please note, changing these settings incorrectly could break some features of your site, and it is not recommended for users without experience.</strong>

<h3>Why wpStickies breaks linking on images?</h3>
<p>
	Since you have to perform mouse actions (e.g. clicking, dragging) on images to add tags, wpStickies needs to suppress regular events like opening the linked content in a new tab in order to provide an uninterrupted experience with using the plugin. However, with selectors or the per images settings you can disable wpStickies on certain images to restore their original behavior.

<h3>wpStickies does not work after moving my site</h3>
<p>
	wpStickies identify images by their URL. If you've moved your site to another domain, you may have to enable the "Use relative URLs" option in the plugin settings. This way wpStickies will try to find your images locally on the new installation, but it could also break tagging on images loaded from external servers.
