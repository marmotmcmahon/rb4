<h3>Auto-update</h3>
<p>
	The auto-update feature requires a valid item purchase code; you can find it by navigating to your CodeCanyon downloads page and downloading your License Certificate for the corresponding item. Your Item Purchase code is in the downloaded text file. Please enter this code at the wpStickies main plugin page under the "News &amp; Updates" section.
</p>
<h3>Manual update</h3>
<p>
	Once you've downloaded the most recent version from your CodeCanyon downloads page you can deactivate and remove the old version, then install the new one. Your tags and settings are in the database, removing the plugin won't touch them. The new version always has backwards compatibility, so you don't have to worry about anything.
</p>
<h3>Changes during updates</h3>
<p>
	Depending on the default settings, you may have to enable or disable some settings related with the new features. If you experience any unwanted behavior change after an update, it is always a good idea to check the plugin settings, there are probably new options to control these changes.
