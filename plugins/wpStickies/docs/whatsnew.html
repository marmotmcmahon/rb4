<h3>Compatibility notice</h3>
<p>
	wpStickies 2.1.0 is a huge update with lots of new features and improvements. While we have targeted 100% compatibility with older versions, unfortunately there are some areas where this was not possible. As a result, we have reseted the options dealing with user permissions, and are asking you to review your plugin settings again. If you have updated via FTP, a plugin re-activation may also be needed.
